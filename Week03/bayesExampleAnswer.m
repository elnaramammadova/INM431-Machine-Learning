%% Bayesian Inference challenge - uniformly distributed initial prior, linear likelihood function

trials = 100; % set number of iterations (see "iterate" below)

count_tails = 0; % ...and tails

%% Initialize x vector, plot

%% Initial prior distribution 

% replace old code for prior distribution with:
prior = 1 + 0*x;  
% gives 1 for each value of x, i.e. a uniform distribution 
% Try replacing with Beta distribution next!

    % let's toss the coin first. 1 = heads, 0 = tails.  
    coin = round(rand); 
    % rounding a number chosen randomly in the range [0,1]
    % How would you make this a biased coin?

        count_tails = count_tails + 1;

    % determine the posterior distribution by pointwise multiplication
    unscaled_posterior = prior .* like;
        
    % Differently from Gaussian functions, unscaled_posterior needs to
    % be nornalized, e.g. by dividing unscaled_posterior by the area 
    % under the curve:
    uns_post_area = trapz(unscaled_posterior)/1000;
    posterior = unscaled_posterior / uns_post_area;
    % check value of post_area below to see why trapz above needs to be
    % divided by 1000
    
    % Consider, as an alternative to the above, rescaling the y-axis 
    % as follows:
    % range = max(unscaled_posterior) - min(unscaled_posterior);
    % posterior = (unscaled_posterior - min(unscaled_posterior)) / range;  
    
    % The above will look good, but check whether the area under the 
    % scaled posterior is equal to 1:
    post_area = trapz(posterior);
    
    % plot the posterior
    plotPost = plot(x, posterior, 'r');

        pause(0.1)

        delete(plotLike);
